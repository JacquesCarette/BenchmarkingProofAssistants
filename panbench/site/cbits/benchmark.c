@brief Pause the GHC RTS, run an executable, record runtime statistics, and

@param[in] envp       The environment variables to pass to the executable.
@param[in] timeout    A timeout, specified in seconds.
@param[out] bench The results of a benchmarking run.
@return 0 if we were able to run the executable, -1 if there was some fatal error.
