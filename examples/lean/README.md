# Some examples of Lean 4

This directory contains some examples of `lean-4`.

# Installation

Instructions for installing `lean-4` can be found here:
- https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/quickstart.html

You can also walk through an interactive online tutorial that 
teaches you how to prove some stuff about the natural numbers,
which is available at the following url. I'd recommend this as
a good first place to start.
