%TODO mandatory: add short abstract of the document
\begin{abstract}
We benchmark four proof assistants (Agda, Idris, Lean and Rocq) through a
single test suite. We focus our benchmarks on the basic features that all
systems based on a similar foundations (dependent type theory) have in common.
We do this by creating an ``over language'' in which to express all the
information we need to be able to output \emph{correct and idiomatic syntax}
for each of our targets. Our benchmarks further focus on ``basic engineering''
of these systems: how do they handle long identifiers, long lines, large
records, large data declarations, and so on.

Our benchmarks reveals both flaws and successes in all systems. We give a
thorough analysis of the results.

We also detail the design of our extensible system. It is designed so that
additional tests and additional system versions can easily be added. A side
effect of this work is a better understanding of the common abstract syntactic
structures of all four systems.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\todo{this itemized list should be expanded into actual text}
\begin{itemize}
\item benchmark system engineering and scaling
\item benchmarking of anything resembling proofs would be a major research
project
\item the languages (of types/expressions and of declarations) of all 4
are quite similar in their surface expressivity, even though all possess a
myriad of specific features that are unshared
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:method}

\todo[inline]{This is really documenting the 'experiment'. The actual details
of the thinking behind the design is in Section~\ref{sec:design}.}

\todo{this itemized list should be expanded into actual text}
\begin{itemize}
\item single language of tests
\item document the setup of tests, high level
\item document the setup of testing infrastructure, high level
\item linear / exponential scaling up of test 'size'
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discuss}
