  abstractNote={Type classes in Haskell allow programmers to define functions that can be used on a set of different types, with a potentially different implementation in each case. For example, type classes are used to support equality and numeric types, and for monadic programming. A commonly requested extension to support ‘multiple parameters’ allows a more general interpretation of classes as relations on types, and has many potentially useful applications. Unfortunately, many of these examples do not work well in practice, leading to ambiguities and inaccuracies in inferred types and delaying the detection of type errors.},

  DOI={10.1109/LICS56636.2023.10175833},
  abstractNote={Brunerie’s 2016 PhD thesis contains the first synthetic proof in Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) of the classical result that the fourth homotopy group of the 3-sphere is ℤ/2ℤ. The proof is one of the most impressive pieces of synthetic homotopy theory to date and uses a lot of advanced classical algebraic topology rephrased synthetically. Furthermore, the proof is fully constructive and the main result can be reduced to the question of whether a particular “Brunerie number” β can be normalized to ±2. The question of whether Brunerie’s proof could be formalized in a proof assistant, either by computing this number or by formalizing the pen-and-paper proof, has since remained open. In this paper, we present a complete formalization in Cubical Agda. We do this by modifying Brunerie’s proof so that a key technical result, whose proof Brunerie only sketched in his thesis, can be avoided. We also present a formalization of a new and much simpler proof that β is ±2. This formalization provides us with a sequence of simpler Brunerie numbers, one of which normalizes very quickly to −2 in Cubical Agda, resulting in a fully formalized computer-assisted proof that pi _4(mathbbS^3) cong mathbbZ/2mathbbZ.},
