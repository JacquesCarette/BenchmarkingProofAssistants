## Project Goal
The goal of this capstone project is to design and build an automated code generator that creates a series of tests of increasing size that will test the efficiency of modern
interactive proof assistants including Lean, Idris, Agda, and Coq. Testing will first be performed on these assistants as ‘language’, then we will move forth with proof testing.
The project will also include a command line interface enabling users to view the time and memory complexity and provide a link redirecting them to local webpages presenting visualizations of the measured data.

## Demo
This is an example output for one of the test cases, please run GitHub Actions to run your own tests!
